## Problem Statement
Sentiment Analysis using text is the field of research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that helps to identify the sentiments of the human being such as positive, negative, or neutral. It is basically a multi-class classification problem using text.

## Dataset
For this project, we are using a dataset called MELD. This dataset consists of contains a total of 7551 training samples, 984 testing samples, 954 validation samples with labeled utterances from 2000 dialogues. Each utterance in dialogues is labeled with one of two sentiments, plus the neutral sentiment. Each labeling was accomplished by 5 workers, and for each utterance in a label, the sentiment category with the highest votes was set as the label of the utterance. Those utterances voted as more than two different sentiments were put into the non-neutral category. Therefore the dataset has a total of 3 types of sentiments ( positive, negative, or neutral ).
